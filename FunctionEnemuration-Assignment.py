# Enter String lavanya
# {'l': 1, 'a': 3, 'v': 1, 'n': 1, 'y': 1}


#10 Write a program that checks if a number is prime using a user-defined function.
# n=int(input("Enter no "))
# p=0
# for i in range(2,n):

#         p=1
# if p==1:
#     print(n,"Not prime")
# else:
#     print(n,"Prime")
# output:
# Enter no 11
# 11 Prime


#11 Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number, and then use it in a program to find the sum of factorials of numbers in a list.
# def fact(n):
#     if n==1 or 0:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return n * fact(n-1)
# print(fact(5))
# for i in [5,6,7,8,9,10]:
#     print(i,fact(i))
# output:
# 5 120
# 6 720
# 7 5040
# 8 40320
# 9 362880
# 10 3628800


#12 Using comprehensions, create a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to 10, and values are their cubes only if the number is odd.
# print({i:i**3 for i in range(1,11) if i%2!=0})
# output:
# {1: 1, 3: 27, 5: 125, 7: 343, 9: 729}



#13 Implement a higher-order function that takes a list of numbers and a lambda function, then applies the lambda to filter out non-prime numbers.


#14 Create a function that returns a nested dictionary representing the Fibonacci series up to n levels. The keys should be the position, and the values should be the Fibonacci numbers.
