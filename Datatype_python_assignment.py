# ase Study 1: Managing a User Data List
# Scenario: You are managing a list of user data, which contains numerical and textual 
# information. The list allows for slicing, modification, 
# merging with other data, and performing product calculations on numeric values.
# Questions:

# 1. Extracting a Subset: How would you slice the list to get the first three elements of the user's data?
# for slicing you need to give index as  [start:End:Step] 
# here start: is from which index you want to start the slicing , by default index is starts from 0
# end: till which index you want to slice ,it will exclude the last element
#step: it represents the diffrence between the next index to  move by defaults it 1

# l=[10,20,30,56,78]
# print(l[:3])
# output:- [10, 20, 30]

# 2. Modifying Data: How can you update the second element of a user's data list, for example changing the age or score?

# by default index of list is starts from 0 hence 2nd elements is denoted at index 1 
# then we will retrive the elemnts at index 1 in list
# age=[10,20,30,40]
# print(age[1])
# output:-20

# 3. Merging Data: How can you merge two lists, one containing user data and the other containing additional information like preferences?
# 1)with help of + operator you can merge 
# 2)with help of extend()method also you can merge the two lists , it will change the original list
# l=["lavanya","neha","Sarika","Nandita"]
# p=["data science",'Data analytics','Statistics']
# print(l+p)
# l.extend(p)
# print(l)

# output:-['lavanya', 'neha', 'Sarika', 'Nandita', 'data science', 'Data analytics', 'Statistics']
#         ['lavanya', 'neha', 'Sarika', 'Nandita', 'data science', 'Data analytics', 'Statistics']

# 4. Calculating the Product: How would you compute the product of numerical values in the user data list, such as multiplying all the user's scores or amounts?
# import math
# l=[10,20,30,40]
# print(math.prod(l))
# output:-240000

# 5. Adding Dynamic Data: How would you prompt the user to input their age or score and add that to an existing list of user data?
# you can get dynamic data from user's with help of input() method
# by default input method type is string you can typeconversion it as you need
# with help of append method you can add new element in list at end of list
# l=[10,20,30]
# l.append(int(input("Enter score")))
# print(l)
# output:-Enter score67
# [10, 20, 30, 67]


# 6. Displaying Data: How can you use an f-string to display a formatted version of the list of user data with dynamic values?
# l=[10,20,30,40]
# print(f'{l[0]} is lowest score the list\n{l[-1]} is highest score in list')
# output:-
# 10 is lowest score the list
# 40 is highest score in list












#  Case Study 2: Employee Records with Tuples

# Scenario: You have an employee records system that stores immutable employee data using tuples. 
# This system allows for slicing data, updating records by creating new tuples, merging employee records, and 
# calculating specific metrics (e.g., salary product).
# Questions:

# 1. Extracting Employee Information: How would you slice the tuple to get the name and role of an employee?
# for slicing you need to give index as  [start:End:Step] 
# here start: is from which index you want to start the slicing , by default index is starts from 0
# end: till which index you want to slice ,it will exclude the last element
# step: it represents the diffrence between the next index to  move by defaults it 1
# t=("lavanya","data scienctist","yash","IIT Teacher")
# print(t[:2])
# output:-('lavanya', 'data scienctist')


# 2. Updating Employee Records: Given that tuples are immutable, how would you "update" the role of an employee by creating a new tuple?
# as tuple is immutable then you can't update it
# if you want to update the you have to convert the tuple into list
# then update the value and again convert the list to tuple
# t_role=('DS',"DA","pythone","Sql Devloper")
# print(t_role)
# t_role=list(t_role)
# t_role[2]="python Devloper"
# t_role=tuple(t_role)
# print(t_role)
# output:-
# ('DS', 'DA', 'pythone', 'Sql Devloper')
# ('DS', 'DA', 'python Devloper', 'Sql Devloper')


# 3. Combining Employee Data: How would you merge two tuples containing employee details into a single tuple?
# by using +  operator you can merge two tuples
# e1=(1,"Mira","Python devloper")
# e2=(2,"lava","Data scientist")
# e3=e1+e2
# print(e3)
# output:-
# (1, 'Mira', 'Python devloper', 2, 'lava', 'Data scientist')



# 4. Calculating Salaries: How would you calculate the product of salaries from two tuples containing employee salary data?
# import math
# sal=(100,200,300,400,900)
# print(math.prod(sal))
# output:-2160000000000


# 5. User Interaction for Record Update: How would you ask the user for input (e.g., new job title) and then update the tuple with that information, while leaving other details unchanged?
# new_job_title=input("enter you new role")
# t=list(("DA","DS"))
# t.append(new_job_title)
# t=tuple(t)
# print(t)
# output:-
# enter you new role python specialist
# ('DA', 'DS', ' python specialist')


# 6. Displaying Employee Details: How can you display the employee tuple in a readable format using an f-string?
# t=(10,"lavanya","Data scientist")
# print(f'id: {t[0]} name: {t[1]} who appointed in x company as role {t[2]}')
# output:-
# id: 10 name: lavanya who appointed in x company as role Data scientist


#  Case Study 3: Managing a Fruit Inventory with Sets
# Scenario: You are working with a set-based inventory system where each item is unique. 
# You need to handle adding, removing, and merging sets, 
# as well as performing set operations like intersection (finding common elements), and user input.
# Questions:

# 1. Adding Inventory Items: How would you add a new fruit to the set of inventory items?
# if you want to add only one element with help of add() you can add new element is set

# fruit={"Mango","Apple"}
# fruit.add("Cherry")
# print(fruit)
# output:-
# {'Cherry', 'Apple', 'Mango'}


# 2. Removing Items from Inventory: How can you remove a specific fruit from the set if itâ€™s no longer available?
# with help of discard or remove you can remov ethe specified item from set
# only difference is that discard will never through error if item is not found which is remove does

# fruit={"Mango","Apple"}
# fruit.discard("Mango")
# print(fruit)
# output:-{'Apple'}

# 3. Combining Inventory: How would you merge two sets of fruits to create a combined inventory with unique fruits from both 
# sets?
#note: you can't merge set by  + oprator 
#with help of update you can merge the sets , update will change the original set 
#with update you can give any iterables like list tuple etc

# fruit={"Mango","Apple"}
# fruits2={"Tamato","Apple","Carrot"}
# # fruit3=fruit+fruits2 # this will not work gives you Type Error
# fruit.update(fruits2)
# print(fruit)
# # output:-
# {'Carrot', 'Tamato', 'Apple', 'Mango'}

# 4. Finding Common Items: How would you perform a "product" operation by finding the common fruits between two sets 
# (e.g., inventory and shopping list)?
# inventory={"Tamato","Apple","Carrot"}
# shopping_list={"Mango","Apple"}
# print(inventory.intersection(shopping_list))

# 5. Simulating Slicing: Since sets are unordered, how can you convert the set to a list and slice it to get the first two fruits?
# you can convert set into list help of list function 
# s=list({"Tamato","Apple","Carrot"})
# print(s[:2])
# output:-
# ['Carrot', 'Apple']

# 6. Updating the Inventory: How would you prompt the user for input to add a new fruit to the inventory set, 
# and display the updated set using an f-string?
# s=set()
# f=input("enter new fruit ")
# s.add(f)
# print(f"Your Favorait Fruits is {s}")
# output:-
# enter new fruit mango
# Your Favorait Fruits is {'Mango'}



#  Case Study: Online Store Inventory Management System

# Scenario:  
# You are tasked with developing an inventory management system for an online store.
# The store manages its product inventory using Python data structures. 
# The product information includes categories, stock quantities, and prices. 
# The system needs to handle operations like updating stock, calculating total sales, merging product lists, and managing user interactions.

# In this scenario, you will work with lists, tuples, and sets to manage different aspects of the inventory system.


# Questions:

# 1. Managing Product Categories (List Slicing and Merging):  
#    The store keeps a list of product categories. 
#    You need to slice the list to display the first three categories and 
#    merge the available categories with new categories coming from a supplier.  
#    How would you slice the list to retrieve the first three product categories?  
#    How would you merge the current list of product categories with a new list of categories provided by a supplier?

# categories=["Kitechen","Electronis","Assesrings","Clothing"]
# supplier=["Jwellary","Homedecores"]
# print(categories[:3]+supplier)
# output:-['Kitechen', 'Electronis', 'Assesrings', 'Jwellary', 'Homedecores']


# 2. Updating Product Information (List Mutation):  
#    The store needs to update the stock quantity of a particular product. 
#    The list contains product dictionaries, where each dictionary has keys like 'name', 'category', and 'stock'.  
#    How would you find the dictionary for a product by its name and update its stock?  
#    How would you adjust the stock for a product when a new shipment arrives?
# shipment_arrives=100
# d={'Mixer':{
#             'category':'Kitechen',
#             'stock':50}
#    }
# d['Mixer']['stock'] += shipment_arrives
# print(d['Mixer'])

# output:-{'category': 'Kitechen', 'stock': 150}


# 3. Calculating Total Sales (Product Calculation with List):  
#    Each product in the store has a price and a stock quantity. 
#   You are asked to calculate the total sales value by multiplying the price of each product by its stock quantity 
#   and summing these values for all products.  
#    How would you calculate the total sales value from a list of product dictionaries, each containing 'price' and 'stock' keys?

# d={
#     'Mixer':{
#             'price':1000,
#             'stock':50,
#             },
#     'T-shirt':{
#             'price':500,
#             'stock':150},
#     'Laptop':{
#             'price':25000,
#             'stock':10},
#     'AC':{
#             'price':2000,
#             'stock':30}

# }
# l=list(d.keys())
# print(l)
# Totals_Salaes=[]
# Totals_Salaes.extend([d[l[0]]['price'] * d[l[0]]['stock'],d[l[1]]['price'] * d[l[1]]['stock'],
#                       d[l[2]]['price'] * d[l[2]]['stock'],d[l[3]]['price'] * d[l[3]]['stock']])
# print("Total_Sales: ",sum(Totals_Salaes))

# output:-Total_Sales:  435000



# 4. Handling Product Identifiers (Tuple Manipulation and Merging):  
#    The product identifiers (product IDs) are stored as tuples. 
#    You are given a tuple of IDs for products that are currently in stock, 
#    and a tuple for products that are out of stock.  
#    How would you merge these two tuples into one list of product IDs, ensuring no duplicates?  
#    How would you retrieve the first five product IDs from the list of available product IDs?
# c_PID=tuple(range(10,16))
# O_PID=tuple(range(1,4))
# P_IDS=list(c_PID)+list(O_PID)
# P_IDS=list(set(P_IDS))
# print(P_IDS[:6])

# output:-[1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12]


# 5. Removing Out-of-Stock Products (Set Mutation):  
#    The store wants to track which products are out of stock using a set. 
#   When a product is out of stock, it is added to a set. If a product is restocked, 
# it is removed from the out-of-stock set and added to the in-stock set.  
#    How would you remove a product from the out-of-stock set and add it to the in-stock set when the product is restocked?  
#    How would you add a product to the out-of-stock set if the stock runs out?

# in_stock={'Mixers','cloths','laptops','AC'}
# o_stock={'Tv','Jwellary'}
# print("*********************Items in Stock********************")
# print("In_stock: ",in_stock)
# print("Out_stock: ",o_stock)
# item_runs_out='AC'
# in_stock.discard(item_runs_out)
# o_stock.add(item_runs_out)
# print("***************Items in Stock after stock runs out************")
# print("In_stock: ",in_stock)
# print("Out_stock: ",o_stock)
# item_restock='Tv'
# o_stock.discard(item_restock)
# in_stock.add(item_restock)
# print("****************Items after Restoked********************")
# print("In_stock: ",in_stock)
# print("Out_stock: ",o_stock)

# output:-
# *********************Items in Stock********************
# In_stock:  {'cloths', 'laptops', 'Mixers', 'AC'}
# Out_stock:  {'Jwellary', 'Tv'}
# ***************Items in Stock after stock runs out************
# In_stock:  {'cloths', 'laptops', 'Mixers'}
# Out_stock:  {'Jwellary', 'Tv', 'AC'}
# ****************Items after Restoked********************
# In_stock:  {'laptops', 'Mixers', 'cloths', 'Tv'}
# Out_stock:  {'Jwellary', 'AC'}

# 6. Performing Set Operations on Inventory (Set Operations and User Input):  
#    The store tracks two sets of products: one set of "promotional" products 
# and another set of "on-sale" products. You need to perform the following operations:  
#    - Find the products that are both promotional and on sale (intersection).  
#    - Combine all products that are either promotional or on sale (union).  
#    - Remove the promotional products from the on-sale set (difference).  
#    How would you perform these operations on the sets and display the results using f-strings?

# promotional={"Mixer",'cloths', 'laptops', 'AC'}
# on_sale={'Jwellary', 'AC','TV','Mixer'}
# print(f'products that are both promotional and on sale: {promotional.intersection(on_sale)}')
# print(f'all products that are either promotional or on sale: {promotional.union(on_sale)}')
# print(f'Products are only on sale set on in promotional: {on_sale.difference(promotional)}')

# output:-
# products that are both promotional and on sale: {'AC', 'Mixer'}
# all products that are either promotional or on sale: {'TV', 'AC', 'Jwellary', 'Mixer', 'cloths', 'laptops'}
# Products are only on sale set on in promotional: {'Jwellary', 'TV'}

# 7. Dynamic Product Search (User Input and f-string):  
#    The store wants to allow customers to search for products based on category. 
# A customer inputs a category name, and the program returns all products in that category. 
# The list contains product dictionaries with keys 'name' and 'category'.  
#    How would you prompt the user for a category, and display all products from that category in a formatted list using an f-string?

# product=    {
#         'Kitechn':['Mixer','Owen','Stow','Kitech_set'],
#         'Cloths':['T-shirts','Shots','Kurtis','Sarees'],
#         'Electronis':['phones','Laptops','Smart-Waches','Tvs'],
#         'HomeDecore':['Doormate','Wallhanging','WallStickers','Designers-curtuns']
#     }
# category=input("Enter Category: ")
# print(product[category])

# output:-
# Enter Category: HomeDecore
# ['Doormate', 'Wallhanging', 'WallStickers', 'Designers-curtuns']
