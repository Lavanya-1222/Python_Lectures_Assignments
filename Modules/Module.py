# 1. Library Management System  
#    - Create a system to manage books in a library.  
#    - Tasks:  
#      1. Store book details like title, author, and availability using appropriate data types.  
#      2. Allow the user to borrow or return books. Use conditional statements to check availability.  
#      3. Implement loops to display all available books.  
#      4. Handle exceptions for invalid inputs (e.g., trying to borrow a non-existent book).  
#      5. Use a module to manage library operations (e.g., a separate module for adding/removing books).  

# 2. Restaurant Billing System  
#    - Develop a billing system for a restaurant.  
#    - Tasks:  
#      1. Create a menu using a dictionary where keys are item names and values are prices.  
#      2. Use a loop to allow customers to order multiple items.  
#      3. Calculate the total bill and apply a conditional discount if the bill exceeds a certain amount.  
#      4. Handle exceptions for invalid item selection.  
#      5. Organize the code into modules for the menu, order processing, and billing.  

# 3. Student Grading System  
#    - Build a system to calculate grades for students.  
#    - Tasks:  
#      1. Accept student details and marks for subjects using appropriate data structures.  
#      2. Use conditions to assign grades based on marks (e.g., A, B, C).  
#      3. Use loops to calculate the average marks of multiple students.  
#      4. Handle exceptions for invalid marks (e.g., marks outside the 0-100 range).  
#      5. Create a module to format and display the student results.  

# 4. ATM Simulation System  
#    - Simulate the operations of an ATM.  
#    - Tasks:  
#      1. Store account details (e.g., account number, balance) using a dictionary.  
#      2. Implement withdrawal, deposit, and balance check functionalities.  
#      3. Use conditional statements to check for sufficient balance before withdrawal.  
#      4. Handle exceptions for invalid transactions (e.g., entering a non-numeric value for withdrawal).  
#      5. Create separate modules for authentication and transaction processing.  

# 5. Inventory Management System  
#    - Create a system to manage product inventory.  
#    - Tasks:  
#      1. Store product details like name, price, and stock quantity using a list of dictionaries.  
#      2. Allow the user to add or remove products from the inventory using conditions.  
#      3. Use loops to display all products and their details.  
#      4. Handle exceptions for invalid inputs (e.g., negative stock quantity).  
#      5. Organize the inventory operations in a module for better structure.
