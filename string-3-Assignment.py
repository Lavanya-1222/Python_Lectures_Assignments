# 1. Reverse a String
# Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed, 
# without using Python's built-in reverse method or slicing.

r=''
for i in s:
    r=i+r

# 3. Palindrome Check
# Write a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same backward and forward).

# 4. String Compression (Optional)
# Write a function that compresses a string by counting consecutive characters. For example, "aaabbbcc" should be compressed to "a3b3c2".

# 5. Find All Unique Characters in a String

# 6. Remove Duplicates from a String

# 7. String Interleaving
# Write a function that checks if one string is an interleaving of two others. For example, "abc" and "def" can interleave to form "adbcef".

# 8. Find Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
# Write a function that finds the length of the longest substring in a given string without repeating characters.

# 9. Count the Number of Occurrences of a Substring
# Write a function that counts the number of times a substring appears in a string, ignoring case.

# 10. Extract Digits from a String
# Write a function that extracts all digits from a given string and returns them as an integer.

# 11. Capitalize the First and Last Character
# Write a function that capitalizes the first and last character of each word in a string. For example, "hello world" should become "HellO WorlD".

# 12. String Rotation
# Write a function that checks if one string is a rotation of another. For example, "abc" and "cab" are rotations of each other.

# 13. Replace All Occurrences of a Substring
# Write a function that replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string with another substring.

# 14. String Without Spaces
# Write a function that removes all spaces from a string.

# 15. Print a String in Reverse Word Order
# Write a function that takes a string and prints the string with the words in reverse order, while keeping each word intact. For example, "I love Python" should become "Python love I".
