# Write a Python function common_elements_in_tuples(tuples_list) that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two sets of integers. The function should return a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains:

# The original tuple from the input.
# A set of integers that are common between the two sets in that tuple.
# If there are no common elements between the two sets in a tuple, exclude that tuple from the result.
# Constraints:
# Each tuple in the input list will contain exactly two sets.
# Sets can have 0 or more integers.
# The result should only include tuples where the intersection of the two sets is not empty.


# [({1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}),({6, 7}, {8, 9}),({10, 11, 12}, {11, 13, 14}),({15}, {16})]
# l=eval(input())
# result=[]
# for i in range(len(l)):
#     if len(l[i][0].intersection(l[i][1]))!=0:
#      result.append((l[i][0],l[i][1],l[i][0].intersection(l[i][1])))

# print(result)

# print
